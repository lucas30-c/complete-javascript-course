The **executor function** in a `Promise` constructor is the core logic that defines the asynchronous task. It is responsible for starting the asynchronous operation, determining when the operation is completed, and calling either the `resolve` or `reject` function based on the outcome.

### Key Responsibilities of an Executor Function:

1. **Initiates the Asynchronous Operation**:
   - The executor function kicks off the asynchronous task, such as making an API call, reading a file, setting a timeout, or performing a background calculation.
   
2. **Handles Success via `resolve`**:
   - If the operation succeeds, the executor function calls the `resolve` function, passing the result or data that indicates success. This transitions the promise from a **pending** state to a **fulfilled** state.

3. **Handles Failure via `reject`**:
   - If the operation fails, the executor calls the `reject` function, passing an error or reason for failure. This transitions the promise from a **pending** state to a **rejected** state.

### Structure of an Executor Function:
The executor function is automatically passed two arguments:
- **`resolve`**: A function to call when the operation completes successfully.
- **`reject`**: A function to call when the operation fails.

Hereâ€™s a basic structure:

```javascript
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  // Asynchronous operation starts here

  // If successful:
  resolve(value); // Call resolve when done, passing a value

  // If an error occurs:
  reject(error); // Call reject if the operation fails, passing an error
});
```

### Example 1: Delayed Success (using `setTimeout`)
```javascript
const delayPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  // Simulating an asynchronous task (waiting for 2 seconds)
  setTimeout(function () {
    resolve('Task completed successfully'); // Call resolve after 2 seconds
  }, 2000);
});
```

In this example, the executor function uses `setTimeout` to simulate an asynchronous delay. After 2 seconds, it calls `resolve`, marking the promise as fulfilled.

### Example 2: Fetching Data with Success and Failure
```javascript
const fetchData = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  const data = fetch('https://api.example.com/data'); // Simulating a fetch operation

  if (data) {
    resolve(data); // Resolve if data is available
  } else {
    reject('No data found'); // Reject if the operation fails
  }
});
```

Here, the executor initiates a data fetch, and depending on the result, it either resolves the promise with the data or rejects it if something goes wrong.

### Summary:
- The **executor function** is where the actual asynchronous logic occurs.
- It is responsible for determining the outcome of the promise by calling either `resolve` (for success) or `reject` (for failure).
- It **must** be provided when creating a new `Promise`, as it defines how the promise will behave.

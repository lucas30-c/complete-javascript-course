## 3 Data Transformation Methods(Map Filter Reduce)

`Map` returns a new array containing the results of applying an operation on all original array elements.
`current * 2`

`Filter` returns a new array containing the array elements that passed a specific test condition
`current > 2`

`Reduce` boils("reduces") all array elements down to one single value(e.g. adding all elements together)
`acc + current`

Map vs forEach
The forEach method may cause side effects, but the map method is a pure function
